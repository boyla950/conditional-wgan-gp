# Deep Learning - Image Generation

This repository contains my solutions to a 3rd year coursework assignment on Deep Learning at **Durham University.**

## Outline

This coursework required the implementation of a Deep Learning model to synthesize images based on the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. While any method could be used, I opted to implemented a Wasserstein GAN which utilised Gradient Penalty and Auxiliary Classification as described [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf). The implentation was developed using PyTorch and can be found in the file [ac-wgan-gp.py](https://github.com/boyla950/deep-learning-coursework/blob/main/ac-wgan-gp.py). The results of the model can be seen in the [report](https://github.com/boyla950/deep-learning-coursework/blob/main/paper.pdf) included in this repository.
